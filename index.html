<p class="p13">I received a job offer mid- <br> course, and the subjects I <br> learned were current, if not more <br> so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s <br> worth.</p>

<p class="p14"> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the <br> bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition <br> and have heard some people who had an <br> amazing experience here. I signed up for the <br> free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I <br> enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks <br> was the best - and most grueling - time of my <br> life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a <br> Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” </p>

<p class="p23">The team was very supportive <br> and kept me motivated</p>

<p class="p24">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding <br> skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big <br> company. This was one of the best investments I’ve <br> made in myself. ”</p>

<p class="p43">Awesome teaching support from <br> TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance <br> from them and learning from <br> their experiences was easy.</p>
 
 
<p class="p44">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my <br> progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program gave me the confidence necessary to be <br> able to go out in the world and present myself as a <br> capable junior developer. The standard is above the <br> rest. You will get the personal attention you need <br> from an incredible community of smart and <br> amazing people. ”

<p class="p53">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

<p class="p54">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a <br> line of code. I needed some structure from <br>
  professionals who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a <br> former 
  student of theirs who can only say <br> wonderful things about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were <br> very hands-on and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, <br> was outstanding. It took my learning to the next <br> level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an <br> example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after <br> receiving multiple offers. 
  100% recommend! ”</p>
